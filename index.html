<h2>A Long story short :</h2>
<p>
    I am a second year graduate student at the <em> <a href="http://is.njit.edu/">New Jersey Institute of Technology.</a></em></p>
<p>
    Talk to me about: Corporate America, technology,movies, philosophy, world affairs, music and life in general at NJIT </p>
<p>
   <strong>Outside of classes</strong> , I spend time with: the International students office where I worked as a student ambassador, 
    leading Continental connections as president, and ideas on how to survive and thrive with <u>five</u> graduate level courses in one semester!
</p>
<p>
    Before coming to NJIT, I went to college in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangalore/">Bangalore</a>, India.I also took part in the Teach India intiative to help under privileged children to learn, which was incredibly fun and rewarding.
